# UX-HIGH-BIAS

> **A high-opinionated UX dev starter. Vibe-code-first.**  
> UX is never neutral, so why should your code be?

## 💡 What is this?

**UX-HIGH-BIAS** is my current creative stack and vibe-coding playground. It’s a public lab where I share what I’m building, testing, and automating — from image montage scripts to experiments in portfolio UX design.

This repo is **alive and evolving**. Expect it to shift into a **ready-to-use UX portfolio builder** designed for "vibe code wannabes" trying to stand out and get hired in a chaotic job market.
