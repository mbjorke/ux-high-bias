------# 🎛️ UX HIGH BIAS — a mixtape of design clarity

Are you feeling overwhelmed by AI Vibes?
Worried you’re not learning the right tools to keep up?
Ready to master vibe coding—not just for today, but for a lifetime?

Welcome to UX HIGH BIAS — where you take control, learn the skills that matter, and build your own unique coding vibe.

No fluff. No hype. Just real tools, real growth, and real command line confidence.

## 🎯 What is this?

A highly opinionated, analog-inspired site template built with:

- 🧩 **Next.js** (v15+)
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** (for that mixtape cover energy)
- 🎬 **Framer Motion** (because static is a vibe killer)
- 🔍 Typescript, Jest, and all the fixings

Built for *creatives who ship weird ideas* and *make clients go “ohhh”.*

## 🔥 Why "High Bias"?

Because UX is never neutral.  
It's tape and intuition and "wait, what if...".

We embrace:
- ✏️ Rough sketches over pixel perfection  
- 🎙️ Clarity over hype  
- 📼 Zines over slideshows  

## 📦 Features

- ⚡ Hero section with motion  
- 🧠 Carousels for your thought-leader drops  
- 🌀 Zine layout (soon™)  
- 🎚️ Modular components  
- 🫐 Clean commit history (because Git tells your real story)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Clone it, tweak it, break it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ux-high-bias.git
cd ux-high-bias
npm install
npm run dev
```


### 👨‍💻 Preparations
Before you plan your launch, here's what you’ll (probably) need:

1. **A Domain**  
   If you don't already have one, check out:  
   - https://namy.ai/  
   - https://www.aidomaingenius.com/

2. **A Server / Hosting**  
   AWS is a solid choice. It’s a *bit* of a process, but it's free for the first year.  
   Not mandatory for the course, but recommended if you're serious about launching your site.

   ✅ **You’ll need:**  
   - An AWS account (Prime users often already have one)  
   - A domain (because a web server without a domain is like a house without an address)  
   - Hosting (for that pro, client-ready feel)

3. **A GitHub Account**  
   Yes, GitHub is free. And yes, you’ll need it for this course.  
   Git (the version control system invented by Linus Torvalds) ≠ GitHub (the cloud platform to store/share your code).  
   You’ll learn Git here—it’s the secret sauce behind *any* pro project.


### 🔗 GitHub Setup (optional but rad)
1. Install GitHub CLI
```bash
brew install gh
```

2. Authenticate (first time only)
```bash
gh auth login
```

Choose GitHub.com, HTTPS, and follow the prompts.

3. Init Git (if not already done)
```bash
git init
```
4. Create a public repo & Push to GitHub (going public is part of the learning experience)
```bash
gh repo create ux-high-bias --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

5. Commit & Push (only git commands, no need to remember)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```
