# 🔐 Security Policy

UX-HIGH-BIAS is a creative lab, but we still take security seriously — especially because this repo may evolve into tools used in live portfolios or websites.

## 🐞 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please **do not open a public issue.**  
Instead, report it privately:

📧 Email: **mbjorke[at]hey[dot]com**  
Or via GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting tools if available.

## ⏱️ Response Time

I aim to respond within **72 hours**, and will work with you to validate, reproduce, and patch any legitimate issues.

## 💡 What Counts as a Vulnerability?

Good to report:
- Access to data or files you shouldn't have
- Code injection or arbitrary script execution
- Deployment misconfigurations (e.g., exposed secrets)

Not needed:
- Obvious broken layouts or visual bugs (file as regular issues)
- Feature requests (use "Feature Request" template)
